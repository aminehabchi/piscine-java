# Piscine Java

**Overview**

This repository contains my work for the **Piscine Java** project. The Piscine is an intensive learning program focused on Java programming, designed to strengthen problem-solving skills, object-oriented programming fundamentals, and collaborative development practices.

**What I Learned**

During this project, I learned and practiced:

* Core Java concepts: variables, data types, methods, classes, and objects
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
* Java syntax and language features: loops, conditionals, arrays, and collections
* Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through coding challenges
* Exception handling and debugging techniques
* File I/O operations and data manipulation
* Java Standard Library and built-in classes
* Unit testing and code validation
* Collaborative coding and code reviews
* Software design patterns and best practices
* Building and organizing Java projects using proper structure

**Experience**

I completed this exercise during a 1-month intensive Piscine in **Zone01 Oujda** in 08/2025. The experience was challenging and rewarding, greatly improving my Java programming skills, understanding of OOP concepts, and ability to learn independently through hands-on practice.

**Repository Structure**

This repository is organized by exercises and projects, each focusing on different aspects of Java programming and software development principles.
